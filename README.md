# Epic-Radiant-Analyst-Preparation
A repository for practicing SQL using Radiant style datasets with realistic STAT and routine delays, cancellations, and CT procedure mix to analyze throughput and safety.
* Datasets used: ![Epic_Radiant_Data](/Datasets/)
* I used ChatGPT to create as close to realistic Epic Radiant datasets as I could get with synthetic data.
* I created a database and relational tables using MySQL.
* Then I imported the datasets into the correct tables and performed several SQL queries to analyze the data.
